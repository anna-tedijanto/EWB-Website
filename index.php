    		<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    		<p>Engineers Without Borders-Cornell is a group of passionate and highly
			motivated students who aim to create long-lasting solutions to problems in
			international communities. Members are given the opportunity to nurture their
			creative and technical expertise by designing and implementing sustainable
			engineering projects. Through collaboration with communities in developing
			countries around the world, our members are exposed to diverse cultures
			while gaining academic experience outside of the classroom environment.
			<br><br>
			Our growing team of 52 dedicated students includes undergraduate and
			graduate students from several of Cornell’s colleges including the College of
			Engineering, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the College of Agriculture
			and Life Sciences. Our network also extends beyond Cornell’s campus to over
			250 EWB chapters.
